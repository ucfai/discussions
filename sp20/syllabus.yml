        For our first paper in intelligence, we'll be covering how to detect
        hate speech using machine learning algorithms. This is a super interesting
        topic, because hate speech is often hard to define and depends a lot
        on the context surrounding it. This review paper will cover current
        state-of-the-art approaches for this problem.

    Many organisms can predict future events from the statistics of past experience, 
    but humans also excel at making predictions by pure reasoning-- integrating multiple 
    sources of information, guided by abstract knowledge, to form rational expectations
    about novel situations, never directly experienced. Here, we show that this reasoning
    is surprisingly rich, powerful, and coherent even in preverbal infants.

    title: 'Towards a Computational Model of Artificial Intuition and Decision Making'

    description: >-
    The ability to perform a detailed decision-making approach based on 
    large quantities of parameters and data is at the core of the majority
    of sciences. Traditionally, all possible scenarios should be considered,
    and their outcomes assessed via a logical and systematic manner to obtain
    accurate and applicable methods for knowledge discovery. However, such 
    approach is typically associated with high computational complexity. In this article
    we discuss some requirements of artificial intuition and present a model of 
    artificial intuition that utilises semantic networks to improve a decision system.
